# AI Browser-Extensions-Recommendation-Chatbot
This project aims to develop a simple Chatbot for Firefox, designed to assist users in discovering safe and high-quality browser extensions from Mozilla's officially curated list of "Firefox Recommended Extensions." The chatbot will engage with users in a user-friendly, non-technical manner, offering brief and straightforward explanations for each extension it suggests. By adhering to these guidelines, the chatbot will provide a valuable tool for Firefox users while also serving as a valuable contribution for my Outreachy application, fostering my growth in open-source technology development. This Jupyter notebook will document the chatbot's development process and code implementation, demonstrating its functionality and facilitating its future hosting on GitHub.
